# Instagram_like_Face_filter
A very basic face filter which is based on Instagram and Snapchat to render different images/emojis over facial points generated by Deep Learning model in Android device.


This repository uses Google's Mobile Vision APIs for facial points detection:

For basic application on facial landmark use:

I have implemented different mask(images/emojis) which looks cool like Instagram and Snapchat application.
Take a look at different mask and drop your own creative ideas with it.

The effects on masks are kept as simple and realistic as possible, such as detectiong 3D rotation of the head which makes the masking more interactive.

Though there is lot more to do such as using a pure animation and rendering framework like UNITY to make the masks more realistic and similar to Instagram.

There is a lot in scope of this application.

Updates will be posted soon......

Meanwhile experiments are welcome.
